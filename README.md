## Description of project

**Quick description of the game**\
We developed a quiz game whose topic is the saving of energy and obtaining knowledge about consumption of activities while having fun.\
There are two game modes - single player and multiplayer. During The single player a user cannot use jokers and emojis, however he has 10 seconds to answer a 
question, after answering a user can see whether he responded correctly immediately. He also can compare his score to the best scores of players that played the single player game on the same server.\
During a multiplayer game a person can play with his friends in order to have more fun, jokers and emojis are enabled. However a player should wait until the timer of the question reaches zero.

**The client can do the following:**
- Change the server to which he is connected
- Play single player game
- Play multiplayer game
- Play with friends if they connect to the same server
- Respond to multiple choice and open-ended questions
- See the solo leaderboard with the highest scores of all player who played on this server
- See a halftime and final leaderboad while player multiplayer
- Use jokers during the multiplayer game
- Use emojis during the multiplayer game
- Add activities to the database 
- Delete activities from the database
- Edit existing activities on the database
- Leave a game whenever he wants to do so

**The server can do the following:**
- Execute requests from the user
- Send information to the clien
- Store activities on the server
- Add/Edit/Delete activities
- Store persistent database with solo leaderboard scores
