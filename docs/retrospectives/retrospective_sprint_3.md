# Retrospective sprint 3

---

**What we researched** \
Han researched how to make a timer class and how to do multithreading.\
Jos researched entity structures for better database design.\
Lucian researched how to use scenebuilder and the correct use of panes.\
Yoan researched different testing methods for interval polling.\
Joris researched how to save and retrieve data from the database in java.\
Okan did not get to do much research because of sickness.\

**What we succeeded in and why?** \
Motivation was low at the beginning of the week, but as the week passed on 
and the pressure to produce something increased, the motivation increased again.
We managed to complete the timer and show it on the frontend, which we also styled
this week. The activities are now being loaded into the database when the server starts running.


**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
Due to the low motivation in the beginning of the week, Okan being sick and some structures
from last sprint not being up to par, we did not accomplish everything we wanted this week.
We slightly overextended ourselves right after the midterm week, but the problem mostly
had to do with us not spending enough time on the project. \
We did not get to finish the interval polling in the waiting room and the question generator.
We will move these issues to sprint 4 and try to complete them as quickly as possible.
