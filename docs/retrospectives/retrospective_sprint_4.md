# Retrospective sprint 4

---

**What we researched** \
Okan researched Random class and used its method for generation of Question class.\
Lucian researched how to deal with client-server communication to make the front-end functional.\
Joris researched how to deal with code conflicts with Gitlab and how to design and test the point calculator.\
Jos researched the JpaRepository about how to make SQL query method work and convert items from the database.\
Yoan researched the implementation of the HTTP method and RestController to generate the QuestionController.\
Han researched how to construct a TestRepository for testing and implement the point calculator.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
Everyone got motivated again in this sprint, focused on their own issues and had a clear goal of
completing the single player game. Thus, we managed to complete the point calculator, 
generate the Question class with inheritance, display the question on question screen, 
implement the client-server communication on game launch.


**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
Due to unexpected technical issues and paying more attention to the single player game, we did
not accomplish the waiting room construction and polling functions inside the game application.
We decide to move the unaccomplished issues to next sprint and try to deal with them soon.
