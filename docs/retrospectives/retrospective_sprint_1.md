# Retrospective sprint 1

---

**What we researched** \
We focused mainly on gaining a better understanding of SceneBuilder, javaFX, and Spring.
We did some research mostly including video tutorials provided to us through the course website which allowed us to begin programming some functionality.

**What we succeeded in and why?** \
Yoan created the actual scenes so that every section of the game had a visual reppresentation
Han provided the endpoints for saving a user to the database.
Jocelyn worked on the front end communications and interactions with the textboxes and questions.
Joris finalized the design of each scene and corresponded with a group of experts for heuristics.
Lucian coded the User class into the commons to be used by both client and server.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
We did not a plan a lot of work this week so we managed to do everything that we planned pretty comfortably
We should probably pick up the pace for the sprints ahead.
