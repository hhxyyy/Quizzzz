# Retrospective Sprint 5

---

**What we researched** \
Okan and Lucian researched WebSocket communication for the game state in waiting rooms and emojis.\
Joris researched possible ways to implement an admin view to make changes in our activities database and 
a more consistent endpoint naming scheme.\
Jos researched interval-polling for the waiting room username display.\
Yoan researched possible improvements for the front-end of our game.\
Han researched how to implement various jokers .


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
We managed to get the brand new admin view working, neared closure on the waiting room issue,
implemented most of the jokers, improved the quality and consistency of our front-end UI, 
and made progress on emojis and autostart of multiplayer games.


**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
Due to an extensive merge conflict, we weren't able to merge Jocelyn's work into main. At the same time,
we ran into problems with endpoint naming for room-specific WebSocket communication, which delayed our 
work in the game state section. We decided to move on and fix the merge conflict and resolve the WebSocket
issues in the next sprint.
