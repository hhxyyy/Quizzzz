# Retrospective sprint 2

---

**What we researched**
Yoan and Okan researched how long and interval polling work.
Joris learned how to work with scene builder and styled the fxml files.
Jocelyn researched how to do the communication for the waiting room and to poll it.
Han and Lucian continued their research on Rest controllers.

**What we succeeded in and why?**
Designing the app in Adobe XD.
We managed to do most of the things, for example styling the scenes. 
Another achievement is the creating of answer controller and how to communicate it to the server.
We created a waiting room class and tested it.

**What we didn't accomplish and why?**
We weren't able to finish the controllers for the waiting room and the front end for 
the polling issue, because it was far too complicated than we expected.
Moreover we had to prepare for the midterms and didn't have enough time to code that much.
