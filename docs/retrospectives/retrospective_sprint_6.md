# Retrospective sprint 6

---

**What we researched** \
Han researched how to use web sockets to in order to implement the last joker.\
Jos researched how to create a persistent database for the solo leaderboard.\
Lucian researched create user session sensible emojis with websockets.\
Yoan researched different testing methods.\
Joris researched how to save images on the server side.\
Okan researched possible improvements for the front-end of our game.\

**What we succeeded in and why?** \
Motivation was low at the beginning of the week, but as the week passed on 
and the pressure to produce something increased, the motivation increased again.\
We managed to complete most of the tasks if not all, but the lack of attention to the merge request slowed down the whole process.
We tested all backend controllers, added more functionalities to the admin panel in order to add and delete activities. Finally the
last joker was implemented and now a player can lower the time for the question of other players once in a game.


**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
Due to the lack of attention to the merge requests we didn't approve three huge merge requests:\
The first one was the solo leaderboard, which was left open for more than 2 days because of poor communication.\
The user session sensible emojis were not working on everyone's machine and therefore it took us some time to figure the issue.\
Not everyone could press the start button and start the game, because we had merge conflicts which were hard to resolve.
