### Discussion on remaining issues
- Reconstruct the joker and finish the last timer joker.
- Change the front question controller for singleplayer and multiplayer.
- The question controller is too large.


### Staying motivated
Most of us get motivated when understand the game and code structure and enjoy creating different functions, 
dealing with many hard issues and implementing new features.



### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
- Move on should/could issues.
- Maybe change the score calcualtion (estimated type question)
for example, shorten the answer range of the open question(adjust the percentage change based on how large the answer is), better from the user prospective.
- Fix the bug, the user's uuid generation in multiplayer mod(maybe caused by hardcoded problem)
- Change the image of the joker.
- Fix the screen size problem. 
- Split the question controller(for now it's very huge).
- Write readMe
- The Code should be human-readable.

### Tip-Top round with feedback from the previous weeks
- Top:Merge many requests and add many new features, everyone gets more motivation
- Tip: More tests are required cause the front-end increases.Group chatting should be read more.
Our work can start more early to be more efficient, and our own tasks should be shared more often, helping each other to debug and improve is also necessary.
- Ta Feedback: Improvements seen, the relationship among the group get better and better. Make sure to better structure and manage the issues.
