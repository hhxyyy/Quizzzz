# Notes Week 4
* Information Literacy assignments mostly went well for everyone.
* First Sprint was successful in terms of workload, but timing and organization could have been better.

## Recommendations for Sprint 2
* Make use of the new 'Closed' tag for better visibility of the work done in TA meetings.
* Comment on merge requests more often.
* If possible, merge development into main before each Monday 5PM for the scripts to run before the TA meetings.
* Watch out for discrimination within the team, even if done subconsciously.
* Issues to be distributed after this meeting.
