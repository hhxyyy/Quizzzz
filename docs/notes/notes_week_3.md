# Notes Week 3
* We should all work individually. Try to assign 1 person to 1 issue
* Also implement a controller this week. It should contain a get, post, put and delete
request
* Epics are suggested, but not mandatory
* Connecting between laptops does not improve our grade, but it does help for testing
and playing
* When merging code, always add tests, otherwise the merge request should not be
approved
* Make sure to do information literacy on time. Preferably next friday, otherwise the
friday of week 4

## Best practises for gitlab
1 feature ⇒ 1 issue  
1 issue ⇒ 1 branch  
1 branch ⇒ 1 merge request  
* You can automatically create a branch and draft merge request for an issue
* Merge to master at end of sprint
* Branches for child issues should branch from the branch of the parent issue which is
a branch of development
* Code review is mostly about human comprehension instead of computer
comprehension. So make suggestions and comments
