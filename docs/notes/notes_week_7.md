## Side notes
- Everyone is having problems with the interval polling
- We can remove the client side for the test coverage
- Test with mockito
- We are kind of using mocktito
- There is no minimum test coverage required

## Feedback from Oskar
- Close sprint issues after the sprint ends
- We should have a task per developer and not a group
- We need definition of task to be done (description or something like this)
- We have a good distribution among the team
- We should use more weights for the tasks
- Some tasks are not estimated (doing, done, tested and so on)
- We should improve our sprint planning
- We are contibuting continuously and there is even distribution
- Focus on commits (we should improve the commit messages and made the commits shorter)
- Gree/yellow flag for formating (add javadoc to some methods)
- Some parts of the code are not tested
- Most people have enough merge requests
- We should merge to main on time
- We are getting better in code reviews (however we should are more comments)
- We are fixig the pipeline on time
- Test sending communication

## Closure
